## General Info
UPG is the first iOS app I ever made! Am really proud of this tiny app because it was the culmination of a ton of tutorials, youtube videos and udemy courses. I love mobile apps, especially on iPhone which is why I wanted to put my sklils to the test. Being a small app (just three screens) it may seem like an easy endeavor, but when its your first app, any developer will agree that you run into the craziest of problems. It was a great learning experience and I can't wait to get started on the next project.

I specifically created a game because the fun and social aspect of these types of apps is quite appealing. It makes you really want to get all the details right. 

### Technologies

  - Coded in Swift4 using Xcode 11
  - Its a very small app with just three screens. The MVC pattern was more than enough to split up the various sections of the project and keep track of them.
  - I did everything in UIKit using Storyboards. I wanted to get familiar with the click and drag interface. Later projects will focus more on programmatic UI (and will most likely be done in SwiftUI).

### Design 

Despite being a small project, I trained myself to make apps using a User Experience approach, dividing up the app into three main stages: 
* Wireframes: starting with user a persona, then the user flow, and ending up with the app's structure.
* Mockups: I then needed to add the color scheme and decided on a UI for the app, resulting in its design
* Build: I went ahead and built the app.

### Setup
To run this project, just clone it to your desktop and run it in Xcode. Any feedback is welcome!
